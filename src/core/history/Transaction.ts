/**
 * Transaction System for Grouping Commands
 *
 * One user action (e.g., drag clip) may generate many commands.
 * Transactions group them into a single undo/redo unit.
 *
 * Example:
 *   beginTransaction("Move Clip")
 *   - updateClipPosition (100 times during drag)
 *   - updateClipTrack
 *   - normalizeTrack
 *   commitTransaction()
 *
 * Result: Single "Move Clip" entry in history
